# CTSC Core

CTSC Core is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a primary focus on energy-efficiency and scalabilty. The CTSC Network makes use of only Proof-of-Stake mining, in the form of masternodes and staking. This means that the CTSC blockchain has a very low impact on the environment and ensures that scaling will be a smooth transition in the future. 

Furthermore, as result of offering multiple ways for users to mint new CTSC coins, the network is a lot less centralized than some Proof-of-Work coins that have their hashrates dominated by one or two mining pools.
